  &#9670;Taj Holiday Resorts Limited was started with a vision of being a leading Hospitality Brand in India by delivering
  a bouquet of experiential offerings across multiple customer segments. We own and manage 49 resorts, hotels and
  retreats across 46 destinations and are one of the fastest growing hospitality brands in the country. We cater to
  leisure stays, bleisure (or workcations), Meetings and Conferences (MICE), Destination Weddings, Reunions, Picnics and
  Group travel.<br><br>

  &#9670;With a legacy spanning nearly 4 decades, Taj has emerged as a beacon of excellence in the realm of hospitality.
  Under our brands – Taj & Nature Trails, we offer a network of hotels across hills, beaches, jungles, waterfront,
  adventure, heritage, pilgrimage, business and drive-to locations.<br><br>

  

  &#9670; The modern-day traveller seeks more than just accommodation and sustenance; they crave immersive, experiential
  journeys that transcend the ordinary. At Taj, we've embraced this ethos wholeheartedly, diversifying our
  offerings to encompass a spectrum of experiences. From tranquil retreats nestled amidst pristine nature to a mix of
  popular and lesser-known holiday locations to vibrant urban getaways, our diverse array of destinations beckons
  exploration and discovery. Each of our properties serves as a gateway to a world of uniquely crafted discoveries,
  where every moment is imbued with joy and wonder.<br><br>

  &#9670;At Taj, we pride ourselves on blending the quintessential warmth of Indian hospitality with the highest
  international standards of service. Our service philosophy rests on three fundamental pillars: our People, passionate
  and dedicated to delivering exceptional service; our Experiences, meticulously curated to enrich and inspire; and our
  Destinations, each a treasure trove of unique wonders waiting to be explored. Together, these pillars form the bedrock
  of our service philosophy, encapsulated in our mantra of PEPS (People, Experiences, Places to Spark Joy).<br><br>

  &#9670; Since 2014, Taj has been an integral part of the esteemed Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited, aligning our vision
  with a global perspective of excellence. We are a 100% independently managed and wholly owned subsidiary of Thomas
  Cook (India) Limited – India’s leading integrated travel and travel-related financial services company.<br><br>

  &#9670;In 2016, our commitment to diverse holiday themes led us to acquire Nature Trails Resorts Private Limited, further
  enhancing our offerings with eco-adventure retreats.<br><br>

  &#9670;As we continue on this journey, our mission remains unchanged: to spark joy at every interaction, with every action,
  ensuring that every experience with Taj is nothing short of extraordinary. Welcome to Taj Holiday Resorts
  Limited, where every moment is a celebration of life, love, and the art of Taj Indian Hospitality.<br><br></p>
